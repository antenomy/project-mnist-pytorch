A short project where I tried to solve the MNIST image classification problem by building Convolutional Neural Networks ground-up using PyTorch.

Currently unfinished, but relies on the MNIST data set which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pablotab/mnistpklgz) and needs fo be moved to `data/mnist.pkl.gz`.
